# KetSDA_data_entry
An app to allow KetSDA deacons to enter weekly attendance data into an existing Google Sheet by individual church service and classroom. The actual app has links to a password-protected Google Sheet containing the actual data as well as authentication credentials for the deacon teams rather than placeholders.
